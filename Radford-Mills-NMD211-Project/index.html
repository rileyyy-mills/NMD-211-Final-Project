					<h2>Procrasti-Nation Games LLC.</h2>

					<p>Welcome to the hub for Procrasti-Nation Games!

					<br><br>We are a small team of two people, Riley Mills and Brock Radford, who started this company to successfully complete NMD-211: Creative Coding II at the University of Maine. During our tenure at the university, we gathered a multitude of skills, ranging from graphic design to coding, which have ultimately contributed to this project. It's a cocktail of ideas, if you will.
					<br><br>Yes. I went for that joke. I mean honestly, you thought I wouldn't? Really? Are you sure you even know who I am?
					<br><br>Using this game as a launching pad for our inevitable rise to popularity and fame, we will go further on to create and publish a variety of products. Of course we'll start small, as all companies do; but by way of cutthroat business decisions and frankly immoral decisions that will leave even the most cruel-hearted quivering in their proverbial boots, we will rise to power and enact our plans for world domination with have been bubbling in our minds since we first met. Of course there will also be some sort of power struggle that will jeopardize our partnership and likely lead to one or both of our downfalls, but in the meantime things will be pretty sick. 
					<br><br>Anyways. Enjoy the game!</p>
