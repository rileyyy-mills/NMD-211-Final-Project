				<h2>Bartender Time</h2>
				<p>
					The purpose of Bartender Time is to expose you to different cultures by learning the history behind
					the drink, enabling you to truly appreciate the beverage you are crafting.
					<br>
					You are a new up and coming bartender and have recently purchased a Tiki themed establishment. When starting a new game you will have to name your
					character, the establishment, and create a "signature drink" with your own custom recipe. Following this you
					will load into your establishment and the timer clock will begin counting down until closing time!
					Your goal is to serve as many customers as possible, while taking care to read the history behind
					each new drink you encounter. At the end of each round you will need to successfully answer as many trivia questions as possible before the timer runs out. 
					<br>
					After three rounds the level will end. If you have a high enough score you may
					move onto the next level, if not then you will have to repeat it.
