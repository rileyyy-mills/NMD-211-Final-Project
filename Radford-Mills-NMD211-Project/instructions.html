				<h2>Bartender Bonanza</h2>
				<p>The earliest known evidence in human history of alcohol dates back to 7000 BCE China, where residue found in clay pots has revealed that people were making an alcoholic beverage from fermented rice, millet, grapes, and honey. Despite that, bartending as a profession has only existed in its modern form for only 150 years! Since the Sazerac was first invented in mid-1800s New Orleans, thousands of recipes have been created and tasted many a time. These drinks can find their roots deep within the oldest cultures known to the modern world, and are often remixed with contemporary spoofs to keep things fresh. By ordering a cocktail at a bar, you unwittingly tap into the combined histories of a myriad of cultures. Bartender Bonanza seeks to enlighten the player about that fact.
				<br><br>Bartender Bonanza is a game in which the player assumes the role of a newly-minted bartender, whose job, as expected, is to make and serve drinks on a per-order basis. When starting up the game, you'll be prompted to enter your name. Following this you will load into your new business, a freshly acquired Tiki themed establishment, and the clock will begin counting down until closing time! Your goal is to fill out as many orders as possible as they come to you. Every completed drink will elicit a pop-up with a picture of the drink you just made, its recipe with correct portions, along with its history and/or cultural significance.
				<br><br>The game can be replayed multiple times, and you may begin to notice that the number of drinks available is not unlimited. But that's good! The faster you begin to memorize drinks, the faster you'll be able to rack up points and aim for the high score! Not only will you come to memorize the recipe, but you'll have the knowledge and cultural context of the drink that you've created multiple times. We've tricked you into learning. Yes, that was our ploy all along - by teasing your budding alcoholism, we've turned you into an educated student of human history. Checkmate. 
				<br><br>Enjoy!
