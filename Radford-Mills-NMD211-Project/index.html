					<h2>Procrasti-Nation Games LLC.</h2>

					<p>Welcome to the hub for Procrasti-Nation Games!</p>

					<p>
						We are a small team of two people, Riley Mills and Brock Radford, who started this company to
						successfully complete NMD-211: Creative Coding II at the University of Maine. If we were a real
						company I would have much more information here, but unfortunately we do not have the time for
						that. Some people may wonder, "how did you decide your company name?" Well, that's a story for
						me to write at a later time.
					</p>

					<p>Thanks for visiting, enjoy the game! As soon as we finish it...</p>
